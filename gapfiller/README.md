# Gapfiller tool for Town

## Usage:
The maths here and method are the exact same as the Blender Importer, refer to that directory if you are interested. This will only explain how the tool can be accessed and used.

### Step 1:
Find a gap that you want to fill, move 3 spheres (or any part) to define the corners of a triangle.

### Step 2:
Group select the 3 spheres you've inserted, and click `SHIFT+P`, which should bring up the Buildverse export GUI, wait until a 4 letter code is generated (It may be shown as "Bv"xxxx, please ignore the "Bv" bit, that's just Buildverse's logo)

### Step 3:
Enter in this URL: http://stingray-digital.online/triangle/YOUR-4-LETTER-CODE except replacing the last bit with **your code**, as for the demo image, it should look like http://stingray-digital.online/triangle/DAXB , open this new link inside your browser, and it should bring you to something that looks like this

### Step 4:
All the data fields are copyable by clicking on them, insert 2 new wedges, then paste these values inside their corresponding tool (Positions goes into Move Tool, Size goes into Resize Tool and Rotation goes into Rotation Tool)

### Step 5:
Now you get 2 wedges which should fill your gap perfectly
