## Usage Instructions:
This repository is not designed to be able to be ran and used straight out the box, this is due to a skill issue on my part not having a Windows PC, thus unable to get macros working on Windows. However from feedback of a few other people who attempted the macro, `pywin32` (https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/) should works the best out of a few mouse/keyboard libraries.
